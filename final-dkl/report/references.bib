pages="159--184",
abstract="We investigate the error versus reject tradeoff for classifiers. Our analysis is motivated by the remarkable similarity in error-reject tradeoff curves for widely differing algorithms classifying handwritten characters. We present the data in a new scaled version that makes this universal character particularly evident. Based on Chow's theory of the error-reject tradeoff and its underlying Bayesian analysis we argue that such universality is in fact to be expected for general classification problems. Furthermore, we extend Chow's theory to classifiers working from finite samples on a broad, albeit limited, class of problems. The problems we consider are effectively binary, i.e., classification problems for which almost all inputs involve a choice between the right classification and at most one predominant alternative. We show that for such problems at most half of the initially rejected inputs would have been erroneously classified. We show further that such problems arise naturally as small perturbations of the PAC model for large training sets. The perturbed model leads us to conclude that the dominant source of error comes from pairwise overlapping categories. For infinite training sets, the overlap is due to noise and/or poor preprocessing. For finite training sets there is an additional contribution from the inevitable displacement of the decision boundaries due to finiteness of the sample. In either case, a rejection mechanism which rejects inputs in a shell surrounding the decision boundaries leads to a universal form for the error-reject tradeoff. Finally, we analyze a specific reject mechanism based on the extent of consensus among an ensemble of classifiers. For the ensemble reject mechanism we find an analytic expression for the error-reject tradeoff based on a maximum entropy estimate of the problem difficulty distribution.",

  abstract = 	 {Data extracted from microarrays are now considered an important source of knowledge about various diseases. Several studies based on microarray data and the use of receiver operating characteristics (ROC) graphs have compared supervised machine learning approaches. These comparisons are based on classification schemes in which all samples are classified, regardless of the degree of confidence associated with the classification of a particular sample on the basis of a given classifier. In the domain of healthcare, it is safer to refrain from classifying a sample if the confidence assigned to the classification is not high enough, rather than classifying all samples even if confidence is low. We describe an approach in which the performance of different classifiers is compared, with the possibility of rejection, based on several reject areas. Using a tradeoff between accuracy and rejection, we propose the use of accuracy-rejection curves (ARCs) and three types of relationship between ARCs for comparisons of the ARCs of two classifiers. Empirical results based on purely synthetic data, semi-synthetic data (generated from real data obtained from patients) and public microarray data for binary classification problems demonstrate the efficacy of this method.}
